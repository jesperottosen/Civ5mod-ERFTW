- Explorers are the only ones to explore Antiquity Sites.
- Explorers eventually upgrades to Great War Infantry.
- Archaeologists and references to landmarks and dig sites have been removed.
- Be aware that AI players can use these too!

Options are:
- Settler 
- Scout (Goody only)
- Tech boost 
- 500 gold
- 250 Culture 
- Expanded map reveal (Goody only)
- Experience boost
- Unit upgrades
